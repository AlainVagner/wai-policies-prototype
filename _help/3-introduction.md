The Webâ€™s pervasive nature and growing importance in the everyday lives of citizens worldwide has led to both changes in the application of existing laws as well as the development of national and regional laws, policies and standards to ensure Web information is accessible to people with disabilities.

The Web Policy Overview table provides a quick and sortable reference to help you compare and contrast the various policies used throughout the world. More details are also available for each country in the sections below the table and can be linked to through the table of contents or through country links provided in the overview table.

[Developing Organizational Policies on Web Accessibility](#developing) addresses issues which frequently arise when establishing policies on Web accessibility, which include:

* simple and comprehensive sample policy statements
* conformance levels for Web sites as well as Web related software
* defining the scope, milestones, and monitoring processes for Web accessibility
