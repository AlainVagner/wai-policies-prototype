-   **Law** – A law has completed the legislation process, and is put
    into effect as the law of the land.
-   **Policy** – Outlines the goals of a government ministry or agency
    as well as the methods and principles to achieve those goals.
    Policies are not laws, but can lead to the development of laws.
-   **Public sector** – Includes government and government-run or owned
    entities, and entities that receive government funding.
-   **Private sector** – Businesses and organizations that are not part
    of the public sector, including non-profit organizations.
-   **WCAG derivative** - Used when a standard is based on a version of
    the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), but some
    requirements were excluded or modified or additional non-WCAG
    requirements were added.
-   **Procurement law** - A law that requires government purchase of
    accessible goods and services.
-   **Procurement recommendation** - An optional, but encouraged goal to
    purchase accessible goods and services.
-   **Mandatory policy** - Required accessibility goals or
    implementation that is not regulated by law.
